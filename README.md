# Predict Bike Sharing Demand with AutoGluon

### Project Overview

In this project, I used the AutoGluon library to train several models for the Bike Sharing Demand competition in Kaggle. I utilized Tabular Prediction to fit data from CSV files provided by the competition. This project demonstrated my ability to use AutoGluon to train several iterations of models and record my personal optimization of the problem.

Bike-sharing demand is highly relevant to related problems companies encounter, such as Uber, Lyft, and DoorDash. Predicting demand not only helps businesses prepare for spikes in their services but also improves customer experience by limiting delays.

In the end, I submitted several entries to the competition and achieved a rank within Kaggle. I also completed a report of my findings that I can share publicly on Kaggle or my personal page, providing a way to showcase my work.

Here are the main steps. I went over each of these in more detail in the pages that followed:
